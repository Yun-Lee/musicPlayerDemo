# musicPlayerDemo
When I first teach my dad how to use Spotify, he consider the recommendation system was amazing, yet the user interface was still difficult to get started. So I think of develop a "easy to use" website for his favorite 70s' classics.
(This is entirely a demo project, not for business use. I got the songs recorded from Spotify)
